Unguard
=======

Command-line tool to decipher logs of Java application obfuscated by ProGuard

Usage:

  unguard -m proguard_mapping_file.txt --output deciphered.log obfuscated.log

Limitations
-----------

Python 2.7 is target platform, Python 3 support is planned to be added later.

Only class and method names are processed. No plans to do deobfuscation of field names and annotations.

False deobfuscation of names can occur. In fact it is hard to tell difference between
a.a.a.a.a.b and a.a.a.a.a.b. Even if it is clear for a human that the former is method b in class a.a.a.a.a and
the latter one is a class b in package a.a.a.a.a. I think you got the point.

Method names are recognized in two specific formats. The first format is appropriate for Java stack traces
(note that the ProGuard renamesourcefileattribute must be exactly "SourceFile"):

    a.a.a.a.a.a(SourceFile:123)

And the second format is appropriate for logging statements that concisely contain autogenerated class, method
name, and line number information as follows (correct line numbers are required for method name detection):

    [a.a.a.a.a.a:123]
